# WikiMaps

WikiMaps is a new app where you can add points to a map, save it to your favourites, and see a list of your favourites and maps that you've contributed to. Maps can have as many points as you like, and include descriptions and photos that you can later edit. Make a map of favourite neighbourhood places, create a vacation wishlist, you name it!
