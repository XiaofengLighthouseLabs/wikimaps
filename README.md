# WikiMaps

WikiMaps is a new app where you can add points to a map, save it to your favourites, and see a list of your favourites and maps that you've contributed to. Maps can have as many points as you like, and include descriptions and photos that you can later edit. Make a map of favourite neighbourhood places, create a vacation wishlist, you name it!


## Getting Started

1. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
2. Update the .env file with your correct local information, including a MAPS_KEY from Google.
3. Install dependencies: `npm i`
4. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
5. Run migrations: `npm run knex migrate:latest`
  - Check the migrations folder to see what gets created in the DB
6. Run the seed: `npm run knex seed:run`
  - Check the seeds file to see what gets seeded in the DB
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`
